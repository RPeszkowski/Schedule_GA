About the project

The program was designed to provide a way of assinging functions for employees at hospital emergency department. The app allows for adding, editing and deleting information about current staff, manually creating a schedule or loading it from a text file and assigning functions. Core of an app consist of genetic optimization algorithm (GA) designed scecifically for the task of assigning functions. Depending of the number of days in a month and the number of shifts during the day there might be up to 558 binary variables in an optimization problem. The standard algorithm was therefore modified to cope with the task of finding a solution fast.
