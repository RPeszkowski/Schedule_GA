# Schedule_GA

To run the app go to Funkcje_GA => Funkcje_GA => Funkcje_GA.exe

About the project

The program was designed to provide a way of assinging functions for employees at hospital emergency department. The app allows for adding, editing and deleting information about current staff, manually creating a schedule or loading it from a text file and assigning functions. Core of an app consist of genetic optimization algorithm (GA) designed scecifically for the task of assigning functions. Depending of the number of days in a month and the number of shifts during the day there might be up to 558 binary variables in an optimization problem. The standard algorithm could not offer more than giving a permissible solution, that did not follow requirements of accepptable solutions, therefore was modified to solve the problem in a much shorter time.

What I learned while working on this project? 

I think, taht the most important realization whas that genetic algorithms are to be designed speciffically for a given task and should consider data format and way of coding information into genes in order not to accidentally mess the data of the same gene from two parents and as a result of this loose information.

For additional information about the app and GA optimization please consider visiting Wiki.
